@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT118 |Paths from clock (PHI2:f) to clock (RCLK:r) are overconstrained because the required time of 1.00 ns is too small.  
@W: MT117 |Paths from clock (RCLK:r) to clock (PHI2:f) are overconstrained because the required time of 1.00 ns is too small.  
@W: MT118 |Paths from clock (nCRAS:f) to clock (RCLK:r) are overconstrained because the required time of 1.00 ns is too small.  
@W: MT116 |Paths from clock (RCLK:r) to clock (PHI2:r) are overconstrained because the required time of 2.00 ns is too small.
