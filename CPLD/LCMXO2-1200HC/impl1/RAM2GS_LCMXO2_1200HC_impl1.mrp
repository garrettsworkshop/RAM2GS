Design Errors/Warnings
----------------------

WARNING - map: UFM was enabled in EFB: Enabling the configuration interface will
     temporarily disable certain features of the device including Power
     Controller, GSR, Hardened User SPI Port, Hardened Primary User I2C Port.
     Functionality is restored after the Flash Memory (UFM/Configuration)
     Interface is disabled using Disable Configuration Interface command 0x26
     followed by Bypass command 0xFF.
