RAM2GS II (GW4201D) expands the Apple IIgs's 
fast memory to 8 MB. 


Low-Power, SDRAM-Based Design
----------------------------------------
Thanks to a modern, low-power design, 
RAM2GS II uses a maximum of 0.15 watts when idle
(30 mA @ 5V) and 0.3W in active use (60 mA @ 5V). 
Unlike other IIgs expansion RAM cards, which are 
built with vintage asynchronous DRAM chips, 
RAM2GS II uses modern SDRAM. This design allows for 
low power consumption and improved reliability 
over other memory cards using 15+ year old chips. 


Small Size, Low-Profile
----------------------------------------
RAM2GS II features a small board outline and is the 
thinnest Apple IIgs expansion memory card ever produced, 
at under 4mm thin. Small and thin dimensions improve 
the mechanical compatibility between RAM2GS II and 
peripheral cards installed into the IIgs's Slot 7.


Adjustable Capacity, Highly Compatible
----------------------------------------
The Apple IIgs can utilize up to 8 MB of fast memory, 
but due to limitations of the Apple IIgs hardware, 
not all 8 MB is considered "DMA-compatible."
Only 4 MB of the 8 MB provided by an expansion RAM 
card such as the RAM2GS II is DMA-compatible, 
and peripheral cards which use DMA are 
not able to access expansion memory beyond 4 MB. 
RAM2GS II implements an adjustable capacity 
feature, allowing the user to select between 
fully DMA-compatible 4 MB capacity, or
partially DMA-compatible 8MB capacity.
Capacity settings can be set temporarily 
or saved in nonvolatile memory. 
The capacity adjustment utility is available on 
_RAM2GS II's support page_.


Ecologically Friendly, Gold-Plated PCB
----------------------------------------
RAM2GS II features a lead-free, ENIG gold-plated,
4-layer PCB and is fully EU RoHS-compliant. 
All units are tested extensively before shipment. 
Only new parts are used to build RAM2GS II, 
and all RAM2GS II cards are manufactured in our 
semi-automated facility in Columbus, Ohio, 
in the United States. 


Open-Source Design
----------------------------------------
RAM2GS II's design is fully open-source. 
The schematics, board layouts, CPLD firmware, 
and utility software are all freely available 
for commercial and noncommercial use.
